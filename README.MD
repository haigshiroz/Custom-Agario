# Reinforcement Learning Agario

Welcome! This is our repository for our CS5100 Final Project: Reinforcement Learning Agar.io.

To view our models and implementations, please choose one of the following branches:

- DQN - For our Deep Q-Network model using the official Agar.io website
- Q_learning - For our Q_learning model using a local python implementation
- NewModel - For a test on running q-learning (not super important)

When swapping to each branch, there will be a README with specific installation instructions.

Thank you for visiting! :)
